# ArUco-follower_robot
"A ROS-based ArUco marker-following robot leveraging computer vision and feedback control for precise navigation. The robot identifies ArUco markers using OpenCV, integrates real-time position tracking, and executes marker-guided movement. This project demonstrates the synergy of robotics and vision systems."
